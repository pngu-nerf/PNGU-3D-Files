Inspired by the Caliburn B Variant by Ruppernutter, I've found that a design with one solid handle is the strongest.

No extra bolts, nuts or other hardware required

The knob is press fit, you may need to round the end of the bolt a little with a file to push on. 

I recommend printing with 5+ walls
